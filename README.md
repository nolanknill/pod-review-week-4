## Andrew

Senior Educator

Maple Leafs Hockey

TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS

I’ve been a web developer for more than ten years now (umm, has it been that long?), with everything from agencies, to small, scrappy startup teams, to bigger companies trying to reinvent slow-moving industries.

The web is an exciting space which moves terrifyingly fast, and it also makes for a lifechanging career. I hope my real-world experiences can help you find your path through that.

I lean towards frontend development, especially JavaScript frameworks and single-page web apps, but I am a full-stack developer and I’ve also dabbled in UX/UI design. I have a special fondness for the mysteries and miracles of CSS.

As well as how to design and write good, maintainable code, I care a lot about how we shape culture, connect with people, and make great places to work.

I’m super into music. I sing, play guitar, and direct a cappella community choirs. I also love hiking, climbing and the great outdoors.

Hey. I’m Nolan, one of the educators for the Web Development program.

I have been in the tech industry for over ten years, working as a full-stack developer with a back-end specialization.

I hope to pass on my passion and knowledge to you, the next generation of developers!
